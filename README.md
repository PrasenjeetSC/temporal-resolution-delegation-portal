# Temporal Resolution Delegation Portal

Welcome to the **Temporal Resolution Delegation Portal**, a high-level simulation of intersubjective ratification of temporal semantics — or more simply, an extremely serious way for two individuals to agree on what "evening" means.

This project is a parody-resolution interface designed with all the gravitas of a United Nations voting mechanism — complete with a secure credential gate, resolution display, and binding ratification via voting protocol.

## 🌐 Live Demo
