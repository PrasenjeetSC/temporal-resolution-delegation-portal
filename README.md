# Temporal Resolution Delegation Portal

Welcome to the **Temporal Resolution Delegation Portal**, a high-level simulation of intersubjective ratification of temporal semantics — or more simply, an extremely serious way for two individuals to agree on what "evening" means.

This project is a parody-resolution interface designed with all the gravitas of a United Nations voting mechanism — complete with a secure credential gate, resolution display, and binding ratification via voting protocol.

## 🌐 Live Demo

This portal is designed to be hosted via GitHub Pages or any static host. You can fork, clone, or download and host the site yourself.

## 🔐 Delegate Credentials

These are **classified credentials** for the **sole voting delegate**. Unauthorized attempts are met with diplomatic rejection and page reloads. Contact the issuing authority (aka your friend) to receive the valid codes.

## 🗳️ Voting Protocol

- Each delegate may vote once.
- Voting options: `Yes (1 vote)` or `Absolutely Yes (2 votes)`
- Resolution passes by default due to pre-cast vote by the Secretariat (i.e., the creator).
- Outcome will be shown post-vote.

## 🎨 Theme

The site emulates institutional formality — think of it as Geneva meets GitHub, dressed in faux-official CSS.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is meant for fun, parody, and perhaps minor philosophical clarity. It should not be used to run actual intergovernmental referenda. Yet.
